How to deploy (Vercel drag & drop)
1. Download the ZIP file and extract it (or upload the ZIP directly to Vercel).
2. Go to https://vercel.com and create an account (free).
3. Create a new project -> Import Project -> Upload (or drag/drop the zip).
4. Vercel will auto-detect a Vite React app. Hit Deploy. That's it â€” you'll get a public URL.
